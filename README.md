##Website Requirements
- Must have at least 3 pages: home page, sponsors page, and contact/about us page.
- Only uses CSS, HTML, and client side javascript. Bootstrap acceptable. 
- Aesthetic pleasing :mount_fuji:

####Home page
- Must have a sort piece on what we are about and what we do.
- Must show our top sponsors (this will be up to the officers to decide).
It is fine to just have placeholders for this part

####Sponsors page
- Must show all our sponsors
- Each sponsor must have an image and a link to their homepage
- A short blurb thanking our sponsors for their support

####Contact/About us page (Can be separated into different pages)
- A description on our club. Who, what, why, where. 
- Links on how to contact us, email, etc.
- Links to our social media
- Google calender of our events

###Other page ideas
####Officers page
- Lists all current officers and positions. Maybe a short bio for each?
- Archive of all past officers.
