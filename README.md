#Contributing
We are currently looking for members to help develop our club website :)!
If youâ€™re interested in helping out please talk to a club officers and
read all the information below. 

###Caveats
Right now we are using GitHub pages to host are website and as a result
we are limited to a static site. Once we move to our own server we can
start using web frameworks that require server side access and as a result
can only use HTML, CSS, and client side javascript. 

###Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of git and github
 
###Process
**Important branch info**
- "dev" branch: developement version of website, used to test website before going live
- "master" branch: live version of website
- feel free to create your own branch to test on.

1. Fork the repo and hack away.
2. Once finished please submit a fork request and inform the developer chair.
3. The club officers will review all the website designs submitted and choose
the one the best fits our needs.  
4. If your website design is selected it will be used indefinitely until the
officers decide to choose another. You will also be credited in the footer of
the site. You could also say you created our site on your resume :D

##Website Requirements
- Must have at least 3 pages: home page, sponsors page, and contact/about us page.
- Only uses CSS, HTML, and client side javascript. Bootstrap acceptable. 
- Aesthetic pleasing :mount_fuji:

####Home page
- Must have a sort piece on what we are about and what we do.
- Must show our top sponsors (this will be up to the officers to decide).
It is fine to just have placeholders for this part

####Sponsors page
- Must show all our sponsors
- Each sponsor must have an image and a link to their homepage
- A short blurb thanking our sponsors for their support

####Contact/About us page (Can be separated into different pages)
- A description on our club. Who, what, why, where. 
- Links on how to contact us, email, etc.
- Links to our social media

###Other page ideas
####Officers page
- Lists all current officers and positions. Maybe a short bio for each?
- Archive of all past officers.
